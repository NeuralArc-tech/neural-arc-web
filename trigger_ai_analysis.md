## AI Triage Analysis

**Priority**: High
**Difficulty**: Medium
**Estimated Timeline**: 2-3 days

### Technical Analysis:
1. **Navigation Overflow**: Classic responsive design issue - fixed width navigation not adapting to mobile
2. **Hero Animation Scaling**: Canvas/animation elements not responsive - common in complex animations
3. **Data Scrub Engine Overlap**: Z-index and positioning issues on smaller screens
4. **Framework Context**: Next.js + Tailwind should make responsive fixes straightforward

### Implementation Strategy:
1. **Phase 1**: Navigation responsive design (hamburger menu or collapsible)
2. **Phase 2**: Animation scaling logic with mobile fallbacks
3. **Phase 3**: Content layout fixes across all sections
